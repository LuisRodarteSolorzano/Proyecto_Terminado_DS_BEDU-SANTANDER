The company is owned by the Volkswagen Group through its subsidiary Audi. In 2015, Lamborghini's 1,175 employees produced 3,248 vehicles.\\n\\nFerruccio Lamborghini, an Italian manufacturing magnate, founded Automobili Ferruccio Lamborghini S.p.A. in 1963 to compete with established marques, including Ferrari. The company gained wide acclaim in 1966 for the Miura sports coupé, which established rear mid-engine, rear wheel drive as the standard layout for high-performance cars of the era. Lamborghini grew rapidly during its first decade, but sales plunged in the wake of the 1973 worldwide financial downturn and the oil crisis. The firm's ownership changed three times after 1973, including a bankruptcy in 1978. American Chrysler Corporation took control of Lamborghini in 1987 and sold it to Malaysian investment group Mycom Setdco and Indonesian group V'Power Corporation in 1994. In 1998, Mycom Setdco and V'Power sold Lamborghini to the Volkswagen Group where it was placed under the control of the group's Audi division.\\n\\nLamborghini produces sports cars and V12 engines for offshore powerboat racing.

In late 1909, the Italian Darracq cars were selling slowly and the Italian partners of the company hired Giuseppe Merosi to design new cars. On June 24, 1910, a new company was founded named A.L.F.A., initially still in partnership with Darracq. The first non-Darracq car produced by the company was the 1910 24 HP, designed by Merosi. A.L.F.A. ventured into motor racing, with drivers Franchini and Ronzoni competing in the 1911 Targa Florio with two 24-hp models. In August 1915, the company came under the direction of Neapolitan entrepreneur Nicola Romeo, who converted the factory to produce military hardware for the Italian and Allied war efforts. In 1920, the name of the company was changed to Alfa Romeo with the Torpedo 20-30 HP the first car to be so badged.\\n\\nAlfa Romeo has competed successfully in many different categories of motorsport, including Grand Prix motor racing, Formula One, sportscar racing, touring car racing, and rallies. It has competed both as a constructor and an engine supplier, via works entries (usually under the name Alfa Corse or Autodelta), and private entries. The first racing car was made in 1913, three years after the foundation of the company, and Alfa Romeo won the inaugural world championship for Grand Prix cars in 1925. The company gained a good name in motorsport, which gave a sporty image to the whole marque. Enzo Ferrari founded the Scuderia Ferrari racing team in 1929 as an Alfa Romeo racing team, before becoming independent in 1939. It holds the world's title of the most wins of any marque in the world.\",\"image\":\"AR-logo.jpg\",\"models\":{\"totalPages\":1,\"models\":[{\"id\":\"c4u1mqnarscc72is00ng|c4u1mqnarscc72is00sg\",\"name\":\"Guilia Quadrifoglio\",\"image\":\"giulia.png\",\"make\":\"Alfa Romeo\",\"makeId\":\"c4u1mqnarscc72is00ng\",\"makeImage\":\"AR-logo.jpg\",\"votes\":4365,\"rank\":1,\"engineVol\":2.9,\"comments\":[\"TEST VOTE\",\"prueba ax\",\"Test Alfa Romeo\"],\"totalComments\":2275},{\"id\":\"c4u1mqnarscc72is00ng|c4u1mqnarscc72is00r0\",\"name\":\"Mito\",\"image\":\"mito.jpg\",\"make\":\"Alfa Romeo\",\"makeId\":\"c4u1mqnarscc72is00ng\",\"makeImage\":\"AR-logo.jpg\",\"votes\":2094,\"rank\":2,\"engineVol\":1.4,\"comments\":[\"2AV3W4MZFDVZV320GRGT\",\"0K28F1TPRVDTBAMLWNAD\",\"XI4XZ940FYXZB845DGCY\"],\"totalComments\":1402},{\"id\":\"c4u1mqnarscc72is00ng|c4u1mqnarscc72is00o0\",\"name\":\"Giulietta\",\"image\":\"giulietta.jpg\",\"make\":\"Alfa Romeo\",\"makeId\":\"c4u1mqnarscc72is00ng\",\"makeImage\":\"AR-logo.jpg\",\"votes\":1851,\"rank\":3,\"engineVol\":1.74,\"comments\":[\"Testing vote for buggy cars\",\"Testing vote for buggy cars\",\"prueba AX1\"],\"totalComments\":1212},{\"id\":\"c4u1mqnarscc72is00ng|c4u1mqnarscc72is00pg\",\"name\":\"4c Spider\",\"image\":\"spider.jpg\",\"make\":\"Alfa Romeo\",\"makeId\":\"c4u1mqnarscc72is00ng\",\"makeImage\":\"AR-logo.jpg\",\"votes\":1755,\"rank\":4,\"engineVol\":1.75,\"comments\":[\"UhiuwDrFLfBgeEQjfnzeDwJeXSQkKbHQJBZunPXEQKEfMltjth\",\"a\",\"Test Comment 1234567890!@#$%^\\u0026*()-=_+[]{};:,.\\u003c\\u003e/?\"],\"totalComments\":1268}]}}\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["[buggy cars rating](https://buggy.justtestit.org/)"],"metadata":{"id":"Tp8jzhhmEX0r"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["[Popular make Alfa Romeo](https://buggy.justtestit.org/make/c4u1mqnarscc72is00ng)"],"metadata":{"id":"ME6hngtCDtaH"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Se emplearon los siguientes recursos como apoyo para realizar esta actividad:\n","\n","- [Pruebas de APIs con Postman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQAQO90LoQU)\n","- [Pruebas de APIs con Postman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQAQO90LoQU&list=RDLVFQAQO90LoQU&index=1)\n","- [Postman Beginner's Course - API Testing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VywxIQ2ZXw4)\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"XGG40ED7Y-BS"}}]}
